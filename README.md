## Why Doppar?

The high-performance, minimalist PHP framework for developers who need raw speed and are willing to build their own application layer

Key highlights:
- ⚡ **Performance-first**: Minimal bloat, JIT-compiled Blade templates, and core optimizations.
- 🧩 **Modular & Scalable**: Feature-based development structure and package architecture.
- 🔒 **Secure & API-ready**: CSRF, input validation, encryption, API auth, TOTP-based 2FA, rate limiting, and JSON-first controllers.
- 📦 **Developer-friendly**: Zero-config API Presenter for clean and consistent API responses.
- 🔧 **Production-ready**: Built-in caching, route optimization, and HTTP performance middleware.
- 🌱 **Extensible**: Packages with routes, migrations, and service providers for clean scaling.

### 1. Performance & Lightweight Architecture
- **Minimal overhead**: Core stripped of third-party dependencies → lightning-fast performance with minimal bloat.
- **JIT compilation for Blade templates**: Optimizations include:
  - Whitespace reduction
  - Echo consolidation
  - Loop simplification
  - Inline small views
  - Lazy-loading components

### 2. Modern, Modular Design
- Inspired by **Laravel’s syntax** but built on **Symfony’s solid foundation**.
- Encourages **feature-based development structure** → promotes organization and scalability.
- Includes robust features out of the box:
  - Routing
  - Middleware
  - Service container
  - Validation
  - ORM
  - Caching
  - API authentication
  - Rate limiting
  - CLI tooling

### 3. Security and API-readiness
- Built-in security features:
  - CSRF protection
  - Input validation
  - Encryption utilities
  - Header-based authentication
  - Throttling & middleware-driven rate limiting

- Strong **API-first focus**:
  - JSON-first controllers
  - Built-in rate limiting
  - API authentication with **Flarion**
  - Standardized JSON responses
- **API Presenter Bundle**: Fully internal, zero-config API presenter. No overrides required.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)**: Industry-standard TOTP-based authentication for secure user accounts.

### 4. Extensibility & Package Architecture
- Modular package system with:
  - Routes
  - Migrations
  - Views
  - Service providers
- Improves adaptability, reusability, and scalability.
- Service providers handle setup and bootstrapping → clean separation of concerns, ideal for large/complex applications.

### 5. Production Readiness
- Optimization tools for live environments:
  - Route caching
  - View caching
  - Config caching
- Middleware support for HTTP caching (e.g., **ETags**) → improves client-side performance and reduces server load.
